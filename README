Ext.ux.chart.SmartLegend
========================

This class is an extension for Ext JS 4 that implements chart Legend with
more advanced behavior than stock Legend.

Features:
    - Legend items sizes are adjusted to font size
    - Legend items can be configured to display any particular text,
      not only fixed Series titles or values
    - Legend draws itself in several rows or columns, depending on the
      orientation.

Note that this class is based on Ext.ux.chart.Legend class, which is
basically the same as Ext.chart.Legend except that some methods were
refactored for better reuse. The same goes for Ext.ux.chart.LegendItem.

This extension is released under GPL 3.0 license, except for
Ext.ux.chart.Legend and Ext.ux.chart.LegendItem classes which are
provided as an example. Commercial licensing is also available.
